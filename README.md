# Processing Sketchbook ðŸ““
Some of the sketches I made in the Processing IDE.

### Structure
This repository is currently organized in two main folders:
- [Genuary 2022](https://github.com/joogps/Processing-Sketchbook/tree/main/Genuary%202022) contains code for my [Genuary 2022](https://genuary.art) entries.
- [The Vault]() contains most (if not all) of the sketches I've worked on from 2018-2019. It's been archived like that because it's very special to me.
